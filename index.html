            <h3>Cosmic Dance</h3>
            <p class="poem-content">
               Our minds blur at the edges <br>
            your thoughts, my thoughts, 
                a single pulse.
              <br>
              Time, a living thread, <br>
              moving slowly through the strings, 
               the universe hums.
              <br>
              A distant sun rises, 
        black trees casting shadows on us, 
        while we are drifting through the golden beams.

            <p class="poem-content"><br>
                It's almost like I hear you saying,
                "So, what do you want?"
                "I want you," I said in my mind,
                but to you, I said, "Nothing."
                <br><br>
                And so you left, <br>
                thinking that this is what I meant to say.

            <h3>Heartbreak</h3>
            <p class="poem-content">
                "Give it time," you said, <br>
                As if time was gentle, <br>
                As if it did not carve through me <br>
                like wind through withering branches.
